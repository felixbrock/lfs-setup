# Leak gate for public case studies. A checklist is something you
# follow; this is something that stops you. Run it on a candidate case
# study BEFORE opening the publish PR (the /lfs-case-study skill
# requires a clean pass); the owner merging the PR is the human
# backstop behind it.
#
# Two tiers:
#   HARD  — machine-identifying strings => FAIL (exit 1). Concrete
#           values come from the private side ($LFS_CONFIG/machine.env
#           and $LFS_CONFIG/case-study-denylist.txt) so this scanner
#           itself carries no secrets and stays public. Plus generic
#           shapes that must never appear: MAC, LUKS/FS UUID, IPv4.
#   REVIEW— chip-level IDs (USB VID:PID, ACPI VEN_xxxx). NOT a failure:
#           chip-level identifiers are the reproducible teaching value.
#           Printed so a human consciously confirms "chip, not machine".
