# Orphan sweep for the manifest-diff upgrade procedure. Runs INSIDE the chroot.
#
# Why this exists: a naive "in old manifest but not in new" diff flags LIVE
# files, because install tools skip content-identical files (ExtUtils prints
# "Skip ... (unchanged)"; openssl preserves /etc/ssl/*.cnf; make install
# leaves existing symlinks). Deleting those would break the system.
#
# Classification per orphan path:
#   1. dangling symlink                  -> delete
#   2. matches the package's stale regex -> delete (old-version paths)
#   3. no longer exists on disk          -> nothing to do
#   4. otherwise                         -> LIVE: re-adopt into new manifest
#
# Usage (inside chroot): lfs-orphan-sweep.sh PKGID:STALE_REGEX [PKGID:REGEX ...]
# Expects /var/lib/lfs-pkg/PKGID.list and PKGID.list.prev. Removes .prev on
# success. Empty directories left by deletions are pruned.
