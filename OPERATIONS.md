# Operating Model — running LFS as a daily driver

The owner delegates routine OS operations to Claude. This documents what replaces
each piece of Arch infrastructure and who does what.

Companion file: **AGENT-DESIGN.md** — deliberate divergences from LFS that
make the system operable by an agent (boot counting + auto-rollback,
rescue root, machine-readable state, on-system operational journal).
Procedures below assume those mechanisms once they land.

## What Arch provided vs our replacement

| Arch | Ours |
|---|---|
| pacman -Syu update feed | Weekly automated sweep: release-monitoring.org (Anitya) for upstream releases + LFS/BLFS security advisories, filtered to installed packages |
| Signed packages | TLS + book/recorded checksums, pinned in git (weaker; accepted) |
| pacman local DB | /var/lib/lfs-pkg manifests (file lists per package) |
| makepkg/PKGBUILDs | build/*/NNN-pkg.sh scripts in this repo (reproducible, verbatim-from-book where possible) |
| No rollback | Gate D: btrfs root + snapshot-before-upgrade + GRUB fallback kernel |
| Arch security team | High-risk watchlist gets priority: kernel, glibc, openssl, curl, openssh, xorg-server, browser binaries |

## Upgrade procedures

1. **Normal package**: bump version in its script → build in chroot →
   manifest diff (install new, remove orphans) → VM boot-test → apply.
   To be wrapped in a `lfs-pkg upgrade` helper (Gate C deliverable).
2. **Kernel**: build via ch9/020-kernel.sh with new version; keep previous
   kernel + GRUB entry until the new one has boot-tested.
   Venue policy (2026-07-17): kernel builds stay in the build-host
   chroot while the live system runs on removable media — the chroot
   sits on fast internal storage (I/O + flash wear), holds the whole
   config-versioning/stamp/mkimage pipeline, and keeps the VM twin
   coherent from the same script run. Building natively would not even
   save a reboot: the boot *test* needs metal regardless. After the
   migration to a permanent internal disk, stand up and PROVE the
   native on-LFS kernel pipeline BEFORE the old host is retired —
   native builds are the end state once the build host is gone.
   VM scope (2026-07-17): with the live system on metal, the VM is
   rehearsal for boot-critical changes ONLY (kernel, GRUB, initramfs,
   LUKS, systemd/glibc-class); routine userspace upgrades are built
   and verified natively on the live system. The VM is not carried
   past the old host — rehearsal is superseded by rollback machinery:
   it retires when boot counting + fallback kernel + rescue root
   (AGENT-DESIGN D1/D2/D3) are proven on the permanent disk.
3. **Toolchain (glibc/gcc majors)**: NEVER in place. Rebase onto the next
   LFS book edition: re-run the full pipeline (automated), migrate /etc
   deltas + /home, boot-test, switch. Cadence ~6 months.
4. **Upstream binaries** (browser, editors, electron apps): scheduled
   re-fetch of latest releases — the browser is the largest attack surface on the
   whole system and MUST stay current.

## Rules

- The live system never diverges from repo + sources: no hand-edits without
  a script/commit. /etc on the LFS system goes under git.
- Every upgrade batch: snapshot (or VM image copy) first, boot-test after;
  on hardware, boot-counting auto-rollback is the safety net (AGENT-DESIGN
  D1/D2), and the rescue root (D3) is never upgraded in the same batch.
- Every operational session: starts with `system-status`, ends by updating
  /var/lib/agent/STATE.md; all state changes append to
  /var/log/agent-actions.log (D6/D7).
- Security cadence (owner-endorsed): tier-1 check
  (scripts/security-check.sh against the Arch security tracker) via
  scheduled cloud run; full /lfs-sweep and the release sweep at lower
  frequencies (the concrete schedule lives in the private config repo).
  The owner gets a digest only when something is actionable, and gives
  go/no-go only for kernel/toolchain-class changes. Rationale: beats a
  realistic rolling-distro baseline (occasional manual -Syu) on patch
  latency.

## Execution reliability (how the agent guarantees this actually happens)

Layered by what each mechanism actually guarantees:

1. **Repo CLAUDE.md** — the operator contract, auto-loaded into every
   session that touches this repo. Hard rules + session bootstrap live
   here. This is enforcement, not recollection.
2. **Skills** (.claude/skills/): /lfs-status (state handshake),
   /lfs-upgrade (manifest-diff upgrade), /lfs-sweep (security/release
   digest). Procedures are executed from these checklists, never
   re-derived from memory.
3. **On-system state** (AGENT-DESIGN D6/D7): STATE.md journal +
   agent-actions.log + system-status. The machine itself is the source
   of truth about the machine; sessions sync from it, not from chat
   history.
4. **Agent memory** (~/.claude/.../memory): orientation only — what the
   project is, where authority lives. Never procedure.
5. **Scheduling**: monitoring (/lfs-sweep steps 1-4 are network+repo
   only) can run as a scheduled routine producing a digest; build/apply
   requires a local session (owner-triggered or local cron running
   claude headless — to be enabled when the cadence is proven manually).
6. **Resumability**: stamps + manifests + background tasks mean any
   interrupted operation resumes surgically; a session ending mid-work
   leaves uncommitted repo changes as the tripwire that /lfs-status
   detects at the next bootstrap.

## Division of labor

- Claude: monitoring sweeps, staged builds, VM boot-tests, manifest
  hygiene, binary refreshes, digests, book-edition rebases.
- The owner: go/no-go on kernel + toolchain upgrades on real hardware,
  occasional interactive smoke tests, hardware-touching steps.

## Open items feeding this (tracked in the private config repo)

- lfs-pkg upgrade helper + tested end-to-end upgrade of one real package
- /etc under git inside the LFS system
- btrfs decision at Gate D (recommended: yes)
- change temporary passwords (root/felix = "lfs") before Gate D
- microcode + firmware packages needed at Gate D (hardware, not VM)
